Also: Pay attention to the general aesthetics of your report (i.e., formatting of the tables, sizing of the figures, etc.). Use inline code to display single numbers, and echo = FALSE for code chunks when you display a table of produce a figure (i.e., we don’t want to see code unless it is necessary). Minimize the amount of code duplication by using iterations concepts and list-columns. Comment your code to explain what you are doing. "],
["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 The data 2.2 A note on Epidemiological Models 2.3 This assigment", " 2 Introduction 2.1 The data For this assignment, we use COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins University (updated daily), as well as data from the world bank with demographic information. More specifically, we use daily records of total confirmed infection cases (or cumulative number of cases), total number of fatalities (or cumulative number of deaths) per country starting from 2020-01-22 until 2020-04-05. The dataset, downloaded on 2020-04-06, contains 12,975 observations and 13 variables (country, iso3c, date, confirmed, deaths, population, land_area_skm, pop_density, pop_largest_city, gdp_capita, life_expectancy, region, income). 2.2 A note on Epidemiological Models Today’s epidemiological models are mostly described by so called SIR-like models (see details in Martcheva 2015, 9–12). In this class of models, the population is divided into three groups: (S)usceptible — people, might get infected; (I)nfectious — people, who carry the infection and can infect others; (R)ecovered/(R)emoved — people, who have already recovered from the disease and got immunity. The SIR model is a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this homework, we focus on the following logistic model (see Batista 2020, 2; Martcheva 2015, 35–36): \\[ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = r \\, C(t) \\cdot \\left[1 - \\frac{C(t)}{K}\\right], \\] where \\(C(t)\\) is the accumulated number of cases at time \\(t\\), \\(r\\) is the growth rate (or infection rate), and \\(K\\) is the final size of epidemic. Let \\(C_0\\) be the initial number of cases: in other words, at time \\(t = 0\\), assume that there was \\(C_0\\) accumulated number of cases. The solution of the logistic model is \\[ C(t) = \\frac{K\\cdot C_0}{C_0 + (K-C_0) \\, \\exp(-r\\,t)}, \\] which looks like a scaled logit model in econometrics. 2.3 This assigment Because we only have access to the confirmed cases that are reported, we use those figures as a proxy for the total number of cases, with the understanding that they almost surely underestimates the actual number of interest. In what follows, we do a preliminary exploration of the data. We then use the logistic model to analyze the spread of COVID-19 and try to predict the final number of accumulated confirmed cases for every country. More specifically, we start by focusing on modelling the spread in Switzerland; then apply the same approach to every country in the dataset. References "],

In particular, include the number of days that have passed since the first confirmed case/death, the current stage for confirmed cases/deaths/mortality (i.e., ratio of deaths to confirmed cases). You can: use either words, or tables, or figures, or a bit of each, group your analysis per country, or region, or a bit of each. Figure 3.1: Figure 1 Figure 3.2: Figure 2 Figure 3.3: Figure 3 Figure 3.4: Figure 4 Figure 3.5: Figure 5 Figure 3.6: Figure 6 Produce a worlwide map of the COVID-19 spread at the latest date available in covid19_data for each country, and describe what you see. Hint: ggplot2 package includes two helpful command for this part, namely map_data() to retrieve a map, and geom_map() to draw a map on a plot. Use expand_limits to make sure you display the whole map of the world. 3.2 Data selection and alignment To compare the speed of the infection spread between countries, we need to “align” the data. In other words, we model the epidemic using equivalent “starting conditions” for every country. To do that, we filter the data so that the number of confirmed cases (in any country) is greater or equal to the maximal number of confirmed cases at the first day of a specific country. Let \\(C_{d, i}\\) be the number of accumulated confirmed cases on day \\(d\\) for country \\(i\\). Let country \\(k\\) be the one such that it had the highest number of reported cases on the first day in the dataset, that is \\(C_{1, k} \\geq C_{1, i}\\) for any other \\(i\\). Find \\(k\\) and discuss. From covid19_data, extract a new table covid19_data_filtered: Select only the countries \\(i\\), which on some day \\(d_{0,i}\\) have \\(C_{d_{0,i}, i} \\geq C_{0, k}\\). We will call this time \\(d_{0,i}\\) a day-zero for country \\(i\\). In the next sections, we model \\(C_i(t) = C_{d_{0,i} + t,i}\\), that is the spread of the epidemic in country \\(i\\) with \\(t\\) representing “event days”. Remember, for every country the day-zero is, in general, different. However, when a country entered the epidemic stage, we are only interested in number of days that has passed from the date of entry (i.e. day-zero). Remove countries who are left with less than two weeks of data, i.e. we keep those countries whose number of days that has passed from the day-zero of this country is 14 or more. Create a new column called t representing the number of days from the day-zero of this country. Create a new column called confirmed_1e5pop representing the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants. This is useful in order to compare how the spread of the epidemic differs between countries relative to their population. Discuss using either tables or visualizations or both: Which countries are left in covid19_data_filtered? What is the state of the spread there? What is the relationship between t and confirmed_1e5pop?

The measures taken to prevent the covid-19 worldwide have been shared and are common among countries. This preventive measures would have been braked the spread of the virus, making more difficult to reach our threshold of 548. Furthermore, the difference in mean and in protocoles to confirm a case of coronavirus greatly varies among countries in the world. This second barrier is perhaps the greatest to overcome because of the global shortage of testing material. The reported confirmed cases might hide an unknown number of non-tested but positive case to coronavirus (Omitten/hidden cases are like false negative).\\n\\nThe countries removed of our panel due to our filtering are 39: Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Colombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nThe countries included in the filtered data are 28 : Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA\\n&quot; "],

Furthermore, study the evolution (say for \\(t\\) from 0 to 50) of the predictions of the number of confirmed cases from your models. Similarly as was discussed in the last sub-section of the exploratory data analysis, the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants is also important to understand how specific countries are managing the spread of the epidemic. Thus, predict the evolution of this number (i.e., by dividing your predictions for confirmed cases by the population size) and discuss. Hints: Format the fitted parameters using broom::tidy(). For the long-term predictions, you can use data = data.frame(t = 0:50) in add_predictions(). "],
