In particular, include the number of days that have passed since the first confirmed case/death, the current stage for confirmed cases/deaths/mortality (i.e., ratio of deaths to confirmed cases). You can: use either words, or tables, or figures, or a bit of each, group your analysis per country, or region, or a bit of each. The red curve, being the worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19, increased exponentially. We note the sort of hill in December-January, corresponding to the Chinese reported cases, country which faced in first the pandemic. Figure 1.1: Worldwide representation The death rate fortunately, followed another trend: a more linear one. It increased over time, due to the spread of the virus over the world.1.1 The Figure 1.2 depicts the death rate evolving over time. The jumps might be explained by the fast expansion in newly-infected countries, which were caught by the situation for example, or the latent deaths of persons at risk, touched by the COVID-19 during peaks, and so on and so forth. Figure 1.2: Deaths against confirmed Now, we would like to consder the variability of the spread among regions in the world. The below plot 1.3 shows well the disparity existing in the world regions. Europe and Central Asia report the majority of confirmed cases, followed by North America, whose fast covid-19 expansion became the main concern of the medias, while East Asia &amp; Pacific have a flattening curve of reported confirmed cases. The countries in this region were the first ones to face the pandemic and we must add that they have a reputation in the matter of sanitary management what might explain the contained increase in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Figure 1.3: Regarding the region The severity of the COVID-19 is linked as well to the death caused by the virus. Figure 1.4 presents the death rate associated to the seven regions of the world identified in our dataset. Europe and Central Asia lead as well the panel in matter of death rate. Because of the spread of the expansion, the number of cases multiplied but the death rate is as well linked to the response of the governments and the health systems, and the medias reported well the emergency situation of the European health system, what struggled to help many people (e.g. in Italy, in Spain.) The death rate observed for North America is as well another information to keep in mind: the death rate increases lately but very rapidly. Figure 1.4: Regarding the region Figure 1.5: Deaths against confrimed Now, we should analyze the contamination rate of those regions, which is determined by the ratio of confirmed cases over population size. The Figure 1.6 presents almost the same curves as the confirmed cases plot. Europa and Central Asia, as well as North America have great increasing contamination rate until April 6th, the last date of our dataset, while the other regions did not have reached 0.025% of contamination rate. Figure 1.6: Regarding the population And unfortunately, the death rate associated to COVID-19 increases with the same trend than the contamination rate for those regions. Figure 1.7: Regarding the population Produce a worlwide map of the COVID-19 spread at the latest date available in covid19_data for each country, and describe what you see. Hint: ggplot2 package includes two helpful command for this part, namely map_data() to retrieve a map, and geom_map() to draw a map on a plot. Use expand_limits to make sure you display the whole map of the world. If we would like to represent the above information more geographically for understanding matter, we would plot it on a map. Doing this, we observe a clear distinction between regions: Africa, South America and Oceania are grouped together as reporting few confirmed cases of COVID-19.1.8 We identified previously Europa &amp; Central Asia as unfortunate leaders in contamination and death rates, what is shows by the map: they are in a intermediary status on the worldwide scale. Italy and Spain appear the European countries in a lighter color, and lighter color means more confirmed cases reported. China is at the same stage than Europa and Central Asia, seemingly. The region of North America, but more precisely USA, is in the worst sanitary status according to our scale. The expansion of the COVID-19 within the USA’s borders and the death rate associated put this country in a mediocre standing. Figure 1.8: Worldmap 1.2 Data selection and alignment To compare the speed of the infection spread between countries, we need to “align” the data. In other words, we model the epidemic using equivalent “starting conditions” for every country. To do that, we filter the data so that the number of confirmed cases (in any country) is greater or equal to the maximal number of confirmed cases at the first day of a specific country. Let \\(C_{d, i}\\) be the number of accumulated confirmed cases on day \\(d\\) for country \\(i\\). Let country \\(k\\) be the one such that it had the highest number of reported cases on the first day in the dataset, that is \\(C_{1, k} \\geq C_{1, i}\\) for any other \\(i\\). Find \\(k\\) and discuss. From covid19_data, extract a new table covid19_data_filtered: Select only the countries \\(i\\), which on some day \\(d_{0,i}\\) have \\(C_{d_{0,i}, i} \\geq C_{0, k}\\). We will call this time \\(d_{0,i}\\) a day-zero for country \\(i\\). In the next sections, we model \\(C_i(t) = C_{d_{0,i} + t,i}\\), that is the spread of the epidemic in country \\(i\\) with \\(t\\) representing “event days”. Remember, for every country the day-zero is, in general, different. However, when a country entered the epidemic stage, we are only interested in number of days that has passed from the date of entry (i.e. day-zero). Remove countries who are left with less than two weeks of data, i.e. we keep those countries whose number of days that has passed from the day-zero of this country is 14 or more. Create a new column called t representing the number of days from the day-zero of this country. Create a new column called confirmed_1e5pop representing the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants. This is useful in order to compare how the spread of the epidemic differs between countries relative to their population. Discuss using either tables or visualizations or both: Which countries are left in covid19_data_filtered? What is the state of the spread there? What is the relationship between t and confirmed_1e5pop? Table 1.1: List of the first countries touched by the pandemic. country date confirmed deaths China 2020-01-22 548 17 Japan 2020-01-22 2 0 Thailand 2020-01-22 2 0 Korea, South 2020-01-22 1 0 USA 2020-01-22 1 0 Afghanistan 2020-01-22 0 0 As we observe in the table 1.1,the \\(k\\) country is China, with 548 confirmed cases ar the earliest data in the data set. In order to do comparisons, we should create a subset where the countries’ day 1 starts when the number of confirmed cases reached 548. Many countries do not appear on the subset covid_data_filtered because of the threshold of 548 confirmed cases,1.1. The measures taken to prevent the covid-19 worldwide have been shared and are common among countries. This preventive measures would have been braked the spread of the virus, making more difficult to reach our threshold of 548. Furthermore, the difference in mean and in protocoles to confirm a case of coronavirus greatly varies among countries in the world. This second barrier is perhaps the greatest to overcome because of the global shortage of testing material. The reported confirmed cases might hide an unknown number of non-tested but positive case to coronavirus (Omitten/hidden cases are like false negative). Table 1.2: Glimpse of the countries’ day 1 aligned country Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Chile China Czechia Denmark Ecuador Finland France Germany Greece Iceland Iran Ireland Israel Italy Japan Korea, South Luxembourg Malaysia Netherlands Norway Pakistan Poland Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland Thailand Turkey United Kingdom USA The countries removed of our panel due to our filtering are 39: Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Colombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates. The countries included in the filtered data are 28 : Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA. As we can observe in the table 1.2. To better understand the trend of the subset of countries, we do similar plots as above. China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain and USA appear in the Figure 1.9, which looks like the the Figure 1.3, plot for regions. Without doing the necessary statistical computation and rather jeepoing at an assumption, those countries might be served as proxy for their region. Figure 1.9: Country with more thab 50000 confrimed case Figure 1.10: Country with more than 50000 confirmed case The Figure 1.10 illustrate the spread of the COVID-19 per 100’000 inhabitants. Because the filtered countires vary in population size, the start of their curve varies as well (because it is relative to the threshold of 548 confirmed cases). Again, USA is one of the unfortunate leader in the expansion of COVID-19 by confirmed cases, but preceded by Spain. "],
["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 The data 2.2 A note on Epidemiological Models 2.3 This assigment", " 2 Introduction 2.1 The data For this assignment, we use COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins University (updated daily), as well as data from the world bank with demographic information. More specifically, we use daily records of total confirmed infection cases (or cumulative number of cases), total number of fatalities (or cumulative number of deaths) per country starting from 2020-01-22 until 2020-04-05. The dataset, downloaded on 2020-04-06, contains 12,975 observations and 13 variables (country, iso3c, date, confirmed, deaths, population, land_area_skm, pop_density, pop_largest_city, gdp_capita, life_expectancy, region, income). 2.2 A note on Epidemiological Models Today’s epidemiological models are mostly described by so called SIR-like models [see details in @Martcheva2015, pp.9--12]. In this class of models, the population is divided into three groups: (S)usceptible — people, might get infected; (I)nfectious — people, who carry the infection and can infect others; (R)ecovered/(R)emoved — people, who have already recovered from the disease and got immunity. The SIR model is a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this homework, we focus on the following logistic model [see @Batista2020, pp. 2; @Martcheva2015, pp. 35--36]: \\[ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = r \\, C(t) \\cdot \\left[1 - \\frac{C(t)}{K}\\right], \\] where \\(C(t)\\) is the accumulated number of cases at time \\(t\\), \\(r\\) is the growth rate (or infection rate), and \\(K\\) is the final size of epidemic. Let \\(C_0\\) be the initial number of cases: in other words, at time \\(t = 0\\), assume that there was \\(C_0\\) accumulated number of cases. The solution of the logistic model is \\[ C(t) = \\frac{K\\cdot C_0}{C_0 + (K-C_0) \\, \\exp(-r\\,t)}, \\] which looks like a scaled logit model in econometrics. 2.3 This assigment Because we only have access to the confirmed cases that are reported, we use those figures as a proxy for the total number of cases, with the understanding that they almost surely underestimates the actual number of interest. In what follows, we do a preliminary exploration of the data. We then use the logistic model to analyze the spread of COVID-19 and try to predict the final number of accumulated confirmed cases for every country. More specifically, we start by focusing on modelling the spread in Switzerland; then apply the same approach to every country in the dataset. "],

Because, for some countries, the optimization method might not converge, you can use possibly() or something similar. For which country does the optimization fail ? Assess the goodness-of-fit of the logistic model in the various countries. We apply the logistic model on all countries included in the dataset. The model returns for each country the specific value for \\(K_{i}\\) (the final number of cases and for \\(R_{i}\\) (the infection rate). Please find below the results for our 28 countries.

We notice that the Japan doesn’t figure in this table. In order to evaluate the results of the logistic model on all the data set, we would confront the predictions of the model with the observed values of the dataset. Considering the residuals of a model is one of the step for assessing its goodness-of-fit. In the figure 3.1, we plot the evolution of the residuals (difference between predictions and observed values). Figure 3.1: The logistic model 3.2 Fitted parameters and long-term predictions Describe the fitted parameters (i.e., the final size and the infection rates), both on a per-country basis and some aggregate numbers (e.g., total size of the epidemic over all considered countries). Furthermore, study the evolution (say for \\(t\\) from 0 to 50) of the predictions of the number of confirmed cases from your models. Similarly as was discussed in the last sub-section of the exploratory data analysis, the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants is also important to understand how specific countries are managing the spread of the epidemic. Thus, predict the evolution of this number (i.e., by dividing your predictions for confirmed cases by the population size) and discuss. Hints: Format the fitted parameters using broom::tidy(). For the long-term predictions, you can use data = data.frame(t = 0:50) in add_predictions(). After the parametrization of the model, i.e. where t = 50, we plot the predictions of confirmed cases. We observe again smoother curves than the observed ones of the dataset. We decided to focus on the first ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, namely China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and USA, as we observe in the figure 3.2 The model depicts well the strong preventive measures imposed on the Chinese population for preventing an acceleration in the contamination and marginal infections. As soon as about 20 days were spent, China’s curve flattens, so did its curve in the reality, as previously seen in the data set (but again with regards to the data given by China.) The curves of Spain, Italy, France and Germany are above the predicted cases of China and this is caused in reality by the slowliness of the Occidental governments’ reactions and the culture of each countries. The predictions seems to reproduce the patterns observed in reality, in spite of the tendancy of the residuals to increase over time. Iran, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Turkey take part of another cluster of countries, whose predicted confirmed cases are lower than China’s ones, and much more flat. Those countries have been strongly touched by the coronavirus, but the spread was contained more effectively. However, we must remind that this cluster reached their starting day (day when they reached 548 confirmed cases) later than China or the cluster formed by Spain, Italy, Germany, France. The data visualized is the predictions after having reached 548 cases and the time span required to reach those 548 confirmed cases might have taken some time which allowed them to apply preventive measures, reason why their curves flattened. We could consider this point as a contained expansion of the covid-19, even if those countries are in the top 10 of the countries the most affected by covid-19. Finally, USA skyrocks the contamination prediction of covid-19. Later touched in reality, the logistic model presents well the exponential character with early non-restrictive measures applied preventively against covid-19. The laisser-faire of the American government has faced an explosion of confirmed cases, what puts USA in a sanitary crisis, which the other countries only have a glimpse. Figure 3.2: Prediction of the evolution What if we look now to the confirmed cases as a proportion of the national population? In fact, we have in our top 10 a strong variation in the population size and rescaling the data might give other insights… Figure 3.3: Prediction regarding the population As we see, the groups we discuss about previously hardly remain, as we could expect. First, China is no more in our top 10 panel, since this country has the largest population on earth. If China was appearant, the worldwide covid-19 crisis would be radically worst! As we can observe in the figure 3.3,the two most touched countries are Luxembourg and Iceland, two countries with a very small size of population. Their effective confirmed cases are above 0.4% of their population, which is concerning and mostly when we consider the slope of the curve: a fast increasing expansion of the covid-19 among their population. In 15 days, the infected population went from 0.1 to 0.4%. Spain, Switzerland and Italy are three countries reaching (or almost) the 0.2 % of infection among their population. We know that the situation of Italy and Spain was worrying with regards to the medias and the expansion of the confirmed cases in the plot above. Yet, those numbers rescaled with respect to the population tell more about the severity the sanitary crisis is. Spain and Italy have respectively more than 45 millions and 60 millions of inhabitants, whereas Switzerland has “only” slightly more than 8 millions. Finally, the last cluster is formed by other European countries: Austria, Belgium, France Germany and Portugal. France and Germany remain in our top 10. What is striking is that our top 10 of countries ranked by their proportion of confirmed cases on their population are in Europa. Europa is the continent the most “touched” by the coronavirus, or should we say that the European governments failed to protect their population by preventive measures and failed to contain the expansion once the covid-19 was within the national borders by applying an under-effective sanitary plan.

Letting \\(C_{i}(t) = C_{d_{0,i} + t,i}\\), the model for country \\(i\\) can be expressed as: \\[ C_{i}(t) = \\frac{K_{i} \\cdot C_{i}(0)}{C_{i}(0) + (K_{i}-C_{i}(0)) \\, \\exp(-R_{i}\\,t)} \\] The goal is to find the final number of cases \\(K_{i}\\) and the infection rate \\(R_{i}\\). We implement this in R using the following function: # here, we assume that data is a data frame with two variables # - t: the number of event days # - confirmed: the number of confirmed cases at time t logistic_model &lt;- function(data) { data &lt;- data %&gt;% arrange(t) C_0 &lt;- data$confirmed[1] C_max &lt;- data$confirmed[nrow(data)] nls( formula = confirmed ~ K / (1 + ((K - C_0) / C_0) * exp(-R * t)), data = data, start = list(K = 2 * C_max, R = 0.5), control = nls.control(minFactor = 1e-6, maxiter = 100) ) } Notice: We use the nonlinear least square method stats::nls to fit the unknown parameters. In R, the formula above is confirmed ~ K / (1 + ((K - C_0)/C_0) * exp(-R * t)). As starting point \\((K_0, R_0)\\) for the optimiser, we set \\(R_0 = 0.5\\) and \\(K_0 = 2 \\, C(t^*)\\), where \\(t^*\\) is the latest information about accumulated confirmed cases. We further set the control argument as nls.control(minFactor = 1e-6, maxiter = 100). 4.2 The logistic model applied to data from Switzerland From covid19_data_filtered, extract a table covid19_ch which corresponds to data for Switzerland. Then: Use the function above to fit the logistic model for Switzerland Describe its output (fitted parameters, broom::tidy() might be useful here) Discuss the goodness-of-fit. Plot the fitted curve, as well as observed data points. Present the predictions of the model. What is the estimated final size of the epidemic and infection rate in Switzerland? As explained above, K is the final number of cases confirmed of convid-19 in Switzerland and R the death rate associated to this virus in this country. The table 4.1 showa that the final estimation for K 21’500 cases with a standard deviation of 373 cases. The p-value of 2.909e-27 is largely under 0.1%, which makes our model significant at a level of 99.9%. Concerning R, we get an 24.60% of death rate with a standard error of 0.00316. The p-value associated is significant at 99.9%. Table 4.1: K = confirmed case, R = Infesction rate term estimate std.error statistic p.value K 2.15e+04 373.286 57.7 0 R 2.46e-01 0.003 77.9 0 The model stops at the day 25. In the table 4.2, we observe that the total number of cases is 20’162.34, we thus expect to have 20’163 confirmed cases of coronavirus after 25 days. The data for Switzerland reports 21’100 confirmed cases of convid-19 for the 25th day. The model is quite reliable, even if the prediction is under the observed value. In the medical field, we prefer overestimate than underestimate, because the risk associated to overestimation is lower than the inverse.

According to the trend of the fitted curve, we might expect that the number of cases qould grow at a lowest rates than between th 5th and 13th day, where the slope is slanted. We conclude that the model represents well the evolution of cases on the time span of the data set, but can’t be used for predicting number of cases among this time laps, or at the expense of goodness of fit: it would underestimate the predicted values. Figure 4.1: Figure 12 Once our logistic model applied, we consider the residuals given by the difference between fitted abd observed values. The figure 4.2 points out the residuals’ variance increasing over time. It means that our model fits less and less well the observed data. A good model has normally no pattern in its residuals, which is not the case here. If we decide to use a model showing a similar pattern, the person must be aware that those model is not well fitted to the data, even if some insight could be caught by it. We will use the our model to pursue our analysis, so we have to remind its limits, somehow stronger than other models with a better goodness-of-fit- A last information is that the residuals have this pendulum trend which increases overtime. It assumes that the error margin woulg be greater over time. Figure 4.2: Figure 13 "]
