In particular, include the number of days that have passed since the first confirmed case/death, the current stage for confirmed cases/deaths/mortality (i.e., ratio of deaths to confirmed cases). You can: use either words, or tables, or figures, or a bit of each, group your analysis per country, or region, or a bit of each. Worldwide analyze Figure 1.1: Figure 1 Figure 1.2: Figure 2 Figure 1.3: Figure 3 Figure 1.4: Figure 4 Figure 1.5: Figure 5 Figure 1.6: Figure 6 Figure 1.7: Figure 7 Produce a worlwide map of the COVID-19 spread at the latest date available in covid19_data for each country, and describe what you see. Hint: ggplot2 package includes two helpful command for this part, namely map_data() to retrieve a map, and geom_map() to draw a map on a plot. Use expand_limits to make sure you display the whole map of the world. Figure 1.8: Figure 8 1.2 Data selection and alignment To compare the speed of the infection spread between countries, we need to “align” the data. In other words, we model the epidemic using equivalent “starting conditions” for every country. To do that, we filter the data so that the number of confirmed cases (in any country) is greater or equal to the maximal number of confirmed cases at the first day of a specific country. Let \\(C_{d, i}\\) be the number of accumulated confirmed cases on day \\(d\\) for country \\(i\\). Let country \\(k\\) be the one such that it had the highest number of reported cases on the first day in the dataset, that is \\(C_{1, k} \\geq C_{1, i}\\) for any other \\(i\\). Find \\(k\\) and discuss. From covid19_data, extract a new table covid19_data_filtered: Select only the countries \\(i\\), which on some day \\(d_{0,i}\\) have \\(C_{d_{0,i}, i} \\geq C_{0, k}\\). We will call this time \\(d_{0,i}\\) a day-zero for country \\(i\\). In the next sections, we model \\(C_i(t) = C_{d_{0,i} + t,i}\\), that is the spread of the epidemic in country \\(i\\) with \\(t\\) representing “event days”. Remember, for every country the day-zero is, in general, different. However, when a country entered the epidemic stage, we are only interested in number of days that has passed from the date of entry (i.e. day-zero). Remove countries who are left with less than two weeks of data, i.e. we keep those countries whose number of days that has passed from the day-zero of this country is 14 or more. Create a new column called t representing the number of days from the day-zero of this country. Create a new column called confirmed_1e5pop representing the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants. This is useful in order to compare how the spread of the epidemic differs between countries relative to their population. Discuss using either tables or visualizations or both: Which countries are left in covid19_data_filtered? What is the state of the spread there? What is the relationship between t and confirmed_1e5pop?

The measures taken to prevent the covid-19 worldwide have been shared and are common among countries. This preventive measures would have been braked the spread of the virus, making more difficult to reach our threshold of 548. Furthermore, the difference in mean and in protocoles to confirm a case of coronavirus greatly varies among countries in the world. This second barrier is perhaps the greatest to overcome because of the global shortage of testing material. The reported confirmed cases might hide an unknown number of non-tested but positive case to coronavirus (Omitten/hidden cases are like false negative). The countries removed of our panel due to our filtering are 39: Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Colombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates. The countries included in the filtered data are 28 : Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA &quot; "]
